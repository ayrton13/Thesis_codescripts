# Thesis_codescripts
This repo contains code scripts from my thesis about cryptocurrency price analysis using chaos theory and machine learning. 
I had based my thesis on two premises: 1) That cryptocurrencies are chaotic (random) by nature and therefore can be investigated using nonlinear methods popular in Chaos Theory. 2) That if there exists some predictive element (determinism) to the prices, we can predict (short-term) future prices using machine or deep learning. 

Tests employed for the first premise:
- Lyapunov exponent  
- Detrended Fluctuation Analysis
- Multifractal Fluctuation Analysis

Tests employed for the second premise:
- Support Vector Machine (cubic)
- Long Short Term Memory algorithm
